Integrify is an AI-powered Deepfake Detection System designed to analyze both video and audio content. It provides users with an intuitive interface to detect manipulated media, visualize suspicious regions, and track detection history. The system leverages Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to increase transparency and trust in AI predictions.

Features
- Video & Audio Deepfake Detection – Detect manipulated content in video and audio files.
- Explainable Results – Generate heatmaps and visual cues highlighting the most manipulated areas.
- Detection History – Registered users can view their past detection records.
- User-Friendly Interface – Streamlined web interface for easy file upload and result interpretation.
- Ethical AI Practices – Designed to minimize the spread of misinformation and support responsible media consumption.
